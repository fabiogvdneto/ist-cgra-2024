# Computer Graphics - Assignment C

## Description

This repository contains the solution for Assignment C for the Computer Graphics course in the academic year 2023/2024. The goal of this assignment is to develop an interactive graphical application using Three.js, focusing on the following aspects:

1. **Scenes and Cameras**:
    - Setting up a scene with a mathematical carousel.
    - Implementing a fixed camera with perspective projection and a stereoscopic camera for VR viewing.

2. **Geometric Modeling**:
    - Creating a carousel with a central cylinder and three concentric rings that can move independently.
    - Modeling parametric surfaces and a Möbius strip using polygon meshes.

3. **Animations and Interactivity**:
    - Controlling the movements of the carousel rings using specific keys.
    - Applying textures and switching between different types of materials and shading.

4. **Lighting**:
    - Setting up directional light and point lights associated with the Möbius strip and parametric surfaces.
    - Implementing a skydome with a texture based on a classic animation video.

5. **Stereoscopic Camera**:
    - Adding support for stereoscopic viewing on VR devices.

## Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts of lighting and materials.
- Model complex geometric surfaces using Three.js.
- Understand the application of textures and the use of stereoscopic cameras.
- Implement an interactive and visually appealing scene.

## Task List

1. Create the base of the carousel with a central cylinder and three movable rings.
2. Create a skydome.
3. Add parametric surfaces to the carousel rings.
4. Set up global lighting with a directional light and an ambient light.
5. Model a Möbius strip with polygon meshes.
6. Add point lights to the Möbius strip and spotlights to the parametric surfaces.
7. Define and switch between different types of materials and shading.
8. Implement a fixed camera and support for stereoscopic viewing.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (Three.js).
3. Run the application on a local server.
4. Use the defined keys to interact with the scene and change lighting and material settings.

## Notes

- The implementation uses only the Three.js library.
- The code follows good object-oriented programming practices to facilitate reuse and scalability.
- The project is configured to work on VR devices.
