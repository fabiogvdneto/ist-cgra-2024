# Computer Graphics Project

This project was carried out as part of the Computer Graphics course in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, with the aim of providing knowledge about interactive computer graphics.

### Project Phases

The project was divided into three phases/deliveries:

1. Sketching scenes, simple technical drawings, and scene graphs using "pen and paper" ([statement-A](https://github.com/fabiogvdneto/ist-cgra-2024/blob/main/statement-A.pdf)).

2. An interactive scene with fixed cameras, a movable camera, instantiation of geometric primitives, simple animations, and collisions ([statement-B](https://github.com/fabiogvdneto/ist-cgra-2024/blob/main/statement-B.pdf)) ([code](https://github.com/fabiogvdneto/ist-cgra-2024/tree/delivery-b)).

3. An interactive scene with meshes, materials, lights, textures, and stereoscopic camera ([statement-C](https://github.com/fabiogvdneto/ist-cgra-2024/blob/main/statement-C.pdf)) ([code](https://github.com/fabiogvdneto/ist-cgra-2024/tree/delivery-c)).

### Template

The code found in this branch was used as the template for completing deliveries B and C.
